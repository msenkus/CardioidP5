# CardioidP5

This is a p5.js script. The way I run this script is in the Processing enviornment. This creates 200 small circles around the radius of a larger circle. Then a multiple is chosen with a slider bar. The default multiple is 2. The program goes number by number and multiplies the current number by the multiple selected. A line is then drawn from the number to the result of the 2 multiplied numbers. 
Note: Numbers once around the circle 1 full revolution repesent the same number in the ones place, Or the "Modulous" Of the number. so if there were only 10 dots, The 10 would represent the 100 or the 1000 and so on. 

1 = 11 , 21 , 31...
2 = 12, 22, 32....
